# Full Stack Projects

In these projects, I have not added css yet, just added functionality. I will add css later.

Once you have gone inside a project directory, make sure you install node_modules by running the following command:-

```sh
npm i
```



My Project backend server runs under this url:

```sh
http://localhost:3000
```
