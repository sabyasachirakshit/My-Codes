# My Codes Repository

## _Saving all codes from the year 2020_

In this repository, I have saved all codes which I have done from 2020. Mostly I have done Python, but I have added other languages as well. C# is the most rare language in whcih I have coded, Python was the most common, and right now I am working on Javascript.

## Features

- In this repository, you may find codes which are common for a beginner programmer to do.
- This repository contains self made projects, intenrship projects.

Always Remember:

> Whatever you code, save it by pushing
> into git, no matter how weak your code is
> because even a weak code can become a reason
> for large system to not work properly. So, never underestimate any code.
